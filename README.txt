Welcome to NoLifeStory!

If you're using windows...

In the NoLifeStory solution you'll find 2 projects:
NoLifeStory is the client
NoLifeServer is the server
All the dependencies are included in the git repo so all you have to do is open the solution and run the project you want.

If you're not using windows...

Get the following libraries:
zlib
SFML2

Then make yourself a makefile or project for whatever IDE you use, and build it somehow.
It's all standard C++ so you shouldn't have any major problems.
